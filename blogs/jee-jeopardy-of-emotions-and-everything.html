<p>Two years of my precious life  years were decided to be kept away for one of the toughest entrance exams,  called JEE, which could let me into the India's finest engineering institutes.  The goal wasn't superimposed upon me, but was out of my obligations to my  talent. engineering was something I want to do, and there was a long list of  side-hustles lined up. The better part was, before getting in the final battle,  I was deemed fit to be an 'ideal contestant' for the JEE.<br />
  Good days of start ended soon. It  wasn’t because I didn’t work hard, but it was some inconsistencies I found in  my approach. To crack JEE is not of having a lot of knowledge altogether (I  agree Advance requires a higher intellect.) You need patience. Things would  happen slow at the start, and there would be no changes in your marks-ranks.  Right environment is another thing, where your surroundings should be conducive  for you to study. Quality of study mattered, not the quantity.<br />
  The biggest mistake I regret till  day was taking the dummy-school programme. The most important phrase ‘renounce  yourself from world’ should have been avoided at all cost.  I gave up those friends, their calls,  meetings for what people advised. That was utter bullshit. I see people who  have had an ambient social life and are in IITs—converse to what I have. Today  I find it relatively hard to integrate into the society as the individual I  used to be. This dummy school and JEE preps combination were the biggest  destroyer of everything—my morale, my social health, my intellect and my <em>feel  good.</em> I kept on comparing myself to those who attended a school and I shifted  to ‘what-ifs’ and never satisfied myself with the situation I was in. truly  said by my faculty, ‘<em>Had we gone to school, we would have <strong>at least</strong> enjoyed our lives there’</em><br />
  There was unsatisfaction that  followed the period long. Call it blaming, or the actual reason, the JEE result  our center gave was the worse in years. It was the most mediocre one, with less  than half clearing Main, and less than a dozen getting into the posh IITs—all  out of a batch of 100. There were series of shocks for students were going to  colleges that weren’t worth the hard work they put in for twenty-four month  period. For example, a friend of mine, quite intelligent, who should have  deserved anything in secondary IITs, was supposedly sitting in BITS Goa. Think,  you can’t say that more than 50 students ruined their paper collectively. This  assertion goes to point that my institution is responsible for the disaster.<br />
But after seeing the long  journey, I must say—It doesn’t matter. In College, you’d hunt for activities of  all sorts- and that’s where one will make a difference. Gone are those days  where an elite set of opportunities were reserved for the IITians. Now it  depends upon what you can do. Go to Gajjumal College, go for Google Summer of  Code, and Google might hire you. IITians stare at this guy—which is completely  possible today. JEE days were of hardwork, consistency and persistence. College  days are of Opportunities, talent and passion. Maybe that’s where all the  difference is.</p></article></div></main><footer class="py-3 my-4 bg-light border-top"> <ul class="nav justify-content-center border-bottom pb-3 mb-3"> <li class="nav-item"><a href="../index.html" class="nav-link px-2 text-body-secondary">Home</a></li> <li class="nav-item"><a href="../blogs.html" class="nav-link px-2 text-body-secondary">Blogs</a></li> <li class="nav-item"><a href="../about.html" class="nav-link px-2 text-body-secondary">About</a></li> </ul> <p class="text-center text-body-secondary">2013-2023 © Jeet Dhokiya</p> </footer> <script src="/docs/5.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-MrcW6ZMFYlzcLA8Nl+NtUVF0sA7MsXsP1UyJoMp4YLEuNSfAP+JcXn/tWtIaxVXM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="../assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
