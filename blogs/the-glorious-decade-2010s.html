<p align="left"><em>A Reflection of what this meant for me</em></p>
<p>As a 18 year old teen, I would have a fuzzy memory of how past years  were, especially in the childhood. At the start of the decade, I was a little  kid, of 10 years of age, who would come back from school, would be most  carefree, deposit in front of the TV, and watch my favourite cartoon—Shin Chan,  when my mom would pester me to eat the lunch.<br />
  This nearly ended with me coming back from my school, under tonnes of  pressure, multitask eating and glaring at the music/news channel and get back  to the study table with piles of books.<br />
  Times change, but I wish to record the bests and worsts of this decade.  Maybe, some fifty odd years later, I would probably laugh at them.<br />
  The faintest memory of 2010 was, FIFA, CWC games happening. Congress hit  a lot of scams underway. I got my first PSP gaming console. First camping from  school.<br />
  2011 was the World Cup and the first F1 race in India. Kolaveri Di and  Chammak Challo were on everyone’s lips, and Ra.One was the movie much awaited.<br />
  2012 was when I grew up. I moved to Middle school, so matured up fast. I  started to see the revolution in mobile technology. Touch screen phones were a  new fad. Internet started to penetrate more into our lives as I remember seeing  the viral ‘Gangnam style’ (I also got my laptop, so loads of memories) 2012  were start of luxurious trips. <br />
  2013 was when puberty hit me more. My height started to shoot! We  brought the first android phone, my own tablet computer and camera. <br />
  2014 was when I entered into computers, designed websites and tried to  be up breast to latest technologies. I physically looked the best during this  year—and had a girl who had a crush on me!<br />
  2015 changed my life. I changed my school, which was a big upset for me.  The first half was relishing in my old school and second was adapting to the  new one. <br />
  2016 was the best year I’ve lived on this planet. Crazy memories with  friends, rise with power, first love, successful results, and everything I  could imagine of. Completely favourite. I started documenting my life in form  of letters/diary.<br />
  2017 followed as the gloomy one. After the first boards,  I lost my school, friends to the <a href="http://vectore.tk/blogs/blog1.html">JEE preps</a> and  entered in a never-ending phase of grief. I switched to Arabic and Mexican pop  music.<br />
  2018 was better than the previous year, yet in the worse notes. It  revolved around some people, JEE preps, hope of making it to worlds’ best  universities and isolation.<br />
  2019 was the sine curve of my life—kept me through the toes. Started  with JEE, another love, damned results, board exams, damned disappointing  results. It ended with falling in love with one, and taking a hard choice of  admission in India. The life in college is chill, happy and going. Still paying  for two year’s mistakes I guess.</p>
